For this, we will use the image processing library, [ImageIO](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), with [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [FreeImage](https://freeimage.sourceforge.io/) as [backend libraries](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/index.html?highlight=plugins#plugins-backend-libraries).\n",

    "## What is a Heat Map?\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier version of this project, the height of the pixels in the final render were directly related to the pixel's age (how long before the current frame the pixel was changed). This looked great as the canvas was first being drawn. New pixels would appear in waves (see my [Star Wars render](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/u0gror/a_long_time_ago_in_a_subreddit_far_far_away/) for an example of this). However, older parts of the canvas didn't look as nice because the pixel placements were more random. The meaning of the pixel heights became less apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than showing the age, it would be better if the pixel heights showed how frequently that pixel had been clicked recently. Early pixels will still be drawn in waves, and the older pixels will have much more variation in height. It will be clear that a pixel's height is related to how popular it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we know how much to change the height of a pixel after its been changed? How do we cause the unchanged pixels to lose height over time? To understand this, we first need to understand exponential decay.\n"

    "## Exponential Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a any number and divide it in half. It will be reduced to half its initial value. Divide the result in half again. The result will be reduced to a quarter of the initial value. If you continue this process the change in value will get smaller and smaller. The result will get close to zero but never reach it. This is what we call exponential decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential decay is everywhere. The cooling of a body at ambient temperature, the radioactive decay of atoms into other forms of matter and energy, and the resale value of cars with milage are all examples of exponential decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Calculate Exponential Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for exponential decay can be given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={N(t) = N_0 e^{(-\\lambda t)}}\">\n",
    "\n",
    "where _N<sub>t</sub>_ is the quantity at time _t_, _N<sub>0</sub>_ is the initial quantity (when _t_ = 0), _e_ is [Euler's number](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)>) and Î» is called the decay constant.

    "### Half Life\n",
    "\n",
    "More than just the title of a great video game, the half life a quantity is the amount of time needed for it to reach half its initial value. Consider the elements of the periodic table, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tellurium-128 has a half life of 2.2 x 10<sup>24</sup> years. If you had a kilogram of Te-128, you would have to wait one hundred trillion times longer than the time since the Big Bang for half of it to decay into other forms of matter and energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements with short half lives are often dangerously radioactive. U-235, the isotope of uranium used in nuclear weapons, has a half life of about 700 million years.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different way of writing the formula for exponential decay described above is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={N(t) = N_0 2^{-{\\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}}}}\">\n",
    "\n",
    "where _t<sub>1/2</sub>_ is the half life.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each frame in our animation, we can use this formula to recalculate the height _N(t)_ of each pixel based on its height in the previous frame _N<sub>0</sub>_ and the half life _t<sub>1/2</sub>_ we are using to control the decay rate of the heat values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's calculate the new height for a pixel if our animation is at 60 frames per second with 1000x playback speed, and a pixel with a starting height of 0.1 meters. We will set the half life to 1 hour, so that the pixel loses half its height each hour (in the simulation time). We know that 1000 ms / 60 FPS = 16.667 ms per frame at 1x speed. For 1000x times speed we just multiply by 1000 to find that _t_ = 16.67 seconds. Then we can just plug our values into the formula to get the pixel height in the new frame:\n",
